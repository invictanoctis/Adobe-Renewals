Detailed Documentation will be added later... For now it's a sort of todo list...

To-Do:
- Main Sending Loop
- Add option to input optional email address to start with after sending loop has failed to prevent double mailing
- Add filter of "current day -> of month" instead of "whole month" to excel list 2
- If possible get list of "Send As" permissions to check if alias is valid

Possible Additions:
- Add update history
- Multi purpose Program: make the whole program have a main menu so that other function than mail can be added
- Look for a possible cloud hosted solution
- Maybe add user authentication instead of app only authentication
